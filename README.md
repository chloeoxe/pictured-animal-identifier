# pictured-animal-identifier
In this project, I aim to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is able to identify whether a picture is showing a dog or a cat. The dataset consists of the training set and test set, and within each of them, there are collections of cat and dog pictures. The cat and dog pictures respectively show cats and dogs of all shapes, sizes, and types, and each picture differs in its lighting, camera angle etc. This allows for the building of a robust CNN that is able to accurately identify between a cat and dog picture despite some differences. The project was developed mainly with Keras, a TensorFlow library.

Topics covered in this project are:
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Convolutional Neural Networks
